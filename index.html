The jME3 Threading Model

jME3 is similar to Swing in that, for speed and efficiency, all changes to the scene graph must be made in a single
update thread. If you make changes only in Control.update(), AppState.update(), or SimpleApplication.simpleUpdate(),
this will happen automatically. However, if you pass work to another thread, you may need to pass results back to the
main jME3 thread so that scene graph changes can take place there.
