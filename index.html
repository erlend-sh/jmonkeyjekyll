The jME3 Threading Model

jME3 is similar to Swing in that, for speed and efficiency, all changes to the scene graph must be made in a single
update thread. If you make changes only in Control.update(), AppState.update(), or SimpleApplication.simpleUpdate(),
this will happen automatically. However, if you pass work to another thread, you may need to pass results back to the
main jME3 thread so that scene graph changes can take place there.

{% highlight java %}
public void rotateGeometry(final Geometry geo, final Quaternion rot) {
    mainApp.enqueue(new Callable<Spatial>() {
        public Spatial call() throws Exception {
            return geo.rotate(rot);
        }
    });
}
{% endhighlight %}

Note that this example does not fetch the returned value by calling <span class="snippet">get()</span> on the Future object returned from <span class="snippet">enqueue()</span>.
This means that the example method <span class="snippet">rotateGeometry()</span> will return immediately and will not wait for the rotation to be
processed before continuing.<br/>
<br/>
If the processing thread needs to wait or needs the return value then <span class="snippet">get()</span> or the other methods in the returned Future
object such as <span class="snippet">isDone()</span> can be used.
